# Boxing-Champions-Shiny-App

A basic Shiny App that I built for my STAT 302 final project. Will improve as I find time to do so. You can take a look at the final product [here!](https://arushiyer12.shinyapps.io/Final_App/)

## **Dataset Source**

This dataset consists of all professional boxers that have been recognized by one of the big four sanctioning bodies as a world champion.

I scraped the dataset myself from the following Wikipedia pages:

-   [List of IBF Champions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IBF_world_champions)

-   [List of WBC Champions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WBC_world_champions)

-   [List of WBA Champions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WBA_world_champions)

-   [List of WBO Champions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WBO_world_champions)

Any data that I imputed was cross-checked with [BoxRec](https://boxrec.com/).

## **Description**

This was my final project for STAT 302: Data Visualization at Northwestern University, Q2 2022-2023. As it was a final project, it was a bit rushed. I have some ideas for this that I plan on implementing whenever I find time.

Currently, the dashboard has two interactive visualizations:

1.  Density plots of the height and reach of the boxing champions by weight class and nationality
2.  Horizontal barplots depicting the counts of boxing champions by nationality and sanctioning body

The source code of the app can be found in the Final_App folder. The actual app is linked at the top of this file.

The data memo was a template I filled out at the start of the quarter for the assignment. I left it for fun, but it's not super important.
